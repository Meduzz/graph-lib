# graph-lib

For now, the lib remains a bit rough around the edges. (Did you get that?)
This, becaue you are in control of how the graph are stored and loaded.
But I believe there's a way for all types of people here.

The plan is to combine relations with the power of Scala collections, 
and see how far we get, while keeping things simple and slim.
(Don't go and load all your entitydata into the graph, stick to Ids)
