# graph-lib

For now the lib remains a bit rough around the edges. (Did you get that?)
Since you are in control of how the graph are stored and loaded.
But I believe there's a way for both types of taste here.

The plan is to combine relations with the power of Scala collections, 
while keeping things simple and slim. (Don't go and load all your entitydata into the graph, stick with Ids)
